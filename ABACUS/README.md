# Hands-On examples of ABACUS.

This directory includes simple hands-on examples of ABACUS.

Five examples are included:
1. MgO_LCAO
2. MgO_PW
3. Si_LCAO
4. Si_PW
5. B_WDM

Each example (except `B_WDM`) includes three types of basic DFT calculation: SCF, optimization and electronic band structure.
`Si_PW` is left empty deliberately for users' own exercise.
`B_WDM` includes three types of calculation: SCF, NSCF and MD.

The file `Hands_On_Commands_ABC.md` collects the basic shell commands in running the three examples in the `MgO_LCAO` directory.
We assume the utilization of the [Bohrium](https://bohrium.dp.tech/) platform to run these examples,
so the jobs are suggested to run under the /data directory.

A. SCF
B. optimization
C. band_structure
